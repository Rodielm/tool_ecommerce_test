## Description

This project is a Spring-based application that demonstrates [briefly describe what your Spring project does]. This README provides instructions on how to build and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) - Required to run Java applications.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - Build and dependency management tool for Java projects.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Version control system for managing project source code.
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - The Spring Boot framework for building Spring applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This command will download project dependencies, compile the code, and package the application into a JAR file.

4. Run the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/<PROJECT_NAME>.jar
   ```

   Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` with the name of your JAR file.

5. Once the application has started, you can access it in your web browser at the following URL:

   - `http://localhost:<PORT>`

   Replace `<PORT>` with the port number configured for your Spring application. By default, Spring Boot applications run on port 8080.

## Additional Configuration

- If your Spring application requires configuration changes, check the `application.properties` or `application.yml` files in the project's resources directory.
- Modify the database configurations, security settings, or any other properties as needed.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the Spring Boot application, go to the terminal where the application is running and press `Ctrl + C`.
